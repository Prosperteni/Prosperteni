# Hello world! 👋

## AI • Robotics • Computer Vision

I am Prosper, an Artificial Intelligence student at **Guilin University of Electronic Technology**, with focus on **robotics, computer vision, and applied machine learning**.

I approach engineering problems from a **systems perspective**: data, models, deployment constraints, and failure modes all matter.

##  Interests

* **Computer Vision for Robotics** (perception, detection, decision-making)
* **AI set to earthly use, wherein:**
  * Multi-modal learning** (vision + tabular + text)
  * Transfer Learning & Domain Generalization

---


## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🔹 CardioTransferX: Cross-Dataset Transfer Learning with Explainable AI for Heart Disease Prediction

**Research Project / Journal Manuscript (Tech Science Press format)**

* Developed a **transfer learning framework** across heterogeneous medical datasets
* Models: **XGBoost, TabNet**
* Datasets: **Cleveland dataset + multi-hospital dataset**
* Focused on:

  * Reducing overfitting
  * Improving cross-dataset generalization
  * Maintaining interpretability using SHAP
* Conducted ablation studies and ROC-AUC evaluations
* Addressed domain shift and feature distribution mismatch

###🔹Sharespace

* Full-stack Flask web application built as a foundation for ML-backed platforms.
* Implemented with authentication-aware layouts, separating pre-login and post-login views to avoid routing conflicts and UI leakage
* Uses state-dependent rendering to coordinate frontend navigation with backend session logic, supporting both section-based navigation and form-driven pages
* Designed for maintainability through clear separation of templates, route handlers, and static assets, with extensibility in mind for future ML integration

---

## 🧪 Current Focus

* Writing **research-grade papers** in AI & robotics
* Designing **realistic, implementable architectures** 
* Completing the B.Sc.in Artificial Intelligence
