# Hello world! 👋

## AI • Robotics • Computer Vision

I am Prosper, an Artificial Intelligence student at **Guilin University of Electronic Technology**, with focus on **robotics, computer vision, and applied machine learning**.

I approach engineering problems from a **systems perspective**: data, models, deployment constraints, and failure modes all matter.
